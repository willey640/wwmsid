        <h3>Book Summary</h3>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of a Dive Shop or what it takes to become and work as a
        Scuba Diving Professional? This book is great for those who enjoy dive stories, jokes, and practical advice.
        Even if you have never dove before, you will find something in this audiobook that will spark your interest
        in diving. I share my many experiences from first trying Scuba to finding a dive job in a tropical paradise.
        I have learned so much since my first breath underwater and hope to share with you all of the tips that will
        make you become the best diver you can be!</p>

        <p><strong>WWMSID: The second book will be available in 2025!</strong> Stories that were not appropriate for new divers were removed
        from the first book. The second book will hold back no punches towards the diving industry, featuring more stories and lessons learned. 
        It also includes the story of what ended my diving career. This book has a clear ending, and I am thankful that I was able to walk away from my injury.</p>
