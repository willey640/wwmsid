    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>My name is Christopher Willey—a multi-talented professional with a dynamic career spanning various industries, including diving, security, retail, geotechnical work, and content creation. Throughout my career, I’ve developed a unique blend of technical skills, leadership abilities, and a deep passion for learning.</p>

        <h2>Career Journey</h2>
        <p>I began my career as a scuba diving instructor and have trained and certified over 250 divers. My expertise extends to technical diving, specialty certifications, and equipment maintenance. Over the years, I’ve worked as a Divemaster, Instructor Trainer, and Dive Center Manager across multiple dive shops in Roatan, Honduras.</p>

        <p>In addition to diving, I have extensive experience in retail management, having served as a Store Manager at Canadian Tire and Assistant Manager in other retail environments. These roles strengthened my customer service, sales, and leadership skills.</p>

        <p>I’ve also worked in geotechnical roles for mining companies, focusing on core sampling, trail scouting, and assisting geologists with operational needs. My technical skills in this field are complemented by my certifications in fall protection, confined spaces, and fatigue awareness.</p>

        <p>Currently, I work as a Security Guard with Securitas and as a Sales Associate/Cashier at Canna Cabana, where I apply my skills in public interaction, sales, and safety management.</p>

        <h2>Certifications and Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diving Certifications:</strong> PADI Master Instructor, Tec Deep Instructor, Freediving Instructor, and numerous specialty instructor certifications (e.g., Shark Ecology, Adaptive Techniques).</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Licenses:</strong> Alberta Class 4 Driver’s License, Manitoba Prospecting License, and Drone Pilot Certification.</li>
            <li><strong>Security and Safety:</strong> First Aid & CPR, Alberta Security Training, WHMIS, Fall Protection, Fire Safety, and Mental Health Awareness.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Python programming, smart contract development (Cardano), HTML/CSS, social media management, and scuba equipment maintenance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Personal Projects and Interests</h2>
        <p>In addition to my professional work, I’ve authored a book, <em>What Would My Scuba Instructor Do?</em>, which explores my experiences and insights from the world of scuba diving. I’m also considering starting a business for my home-grown chilies and enjoy hands-on projects, such as creating custom wire reels for drills.</p>

        <h2>Core Values</h2>
        <p>My approach to life and work is rooted in continuous learning, adaptability, and helping others. I strive to lead by example, whether I’m mentoring new divers, managing a retail team, or ensuring safety in a security role.</p>
